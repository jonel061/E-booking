                        <H3 align='center'>Prehistory</H3>
                        Prehistory can be divided into the Palaeolithic – Old Stone Age and the Neolithic – New Stone Age. In Zrenjanin's regions no archaeological sites of the Palaeolithic have been found. The only exception makes the discovery of mammoth’s head and other bones
                        found on the banks of Tisa River near Novi Bečej in the year 1952.<br> The discovered archaeological sites, however, indicate that these regions had already been inhabited in the early Neolithic period about
                        5000 years BC.<br> The most important archaeological site from this period is so-called Krstić tumulus, near Mužlja, about 10 km (6 mi) away from Zrenjanin.<br> Here were found the ceramics, with interesting ornaments. Beside the
                        brewery ground have been found rough, with coloured fine ceramics, ornaments (Starčevo culture).<br> The middle Neolithic appeared in our area as Vinča and Potisje culture, in the down course of the Tisa River.<br> What makes this
                        area important is the fact that the influence of two parallel cultures flew through it at the same time. <br> The Iron Age has not been enough explored yet.<br> A few regions with some archaeological materials from the Iron Age
                        have been found: in the residential area Šumica a tip of a spear was found and near the oil factory, pieces of ceramics from the Bronze Age were discovered.<br> At the beginning of the common era, this area was settled by many
                        native tribes, but also by many newcomer tribes: the Illyrians, the Celts, the Goths, the Geths, the Sarmatian and Jazghs.<br> In the end of the 3rd century and in the middle of the 4th century, in the area of Zrenjanin and its
                        surroundings, the Sarmatian tribe Roxolani appeared.<br> From this period a Sarmatian’s graveyard has been found in a city residential district, near the railroad bridge.<br> Finally in the necropolis, not far from Aradac, “Mečka”,
                        more than 120 graves, which date from the end of the 6th and the beginning of the 7th century, have been excavated in 1952.
                        <H3 align='center'>After 1991</H3>
                        The town's development has always been strongly affected by the social-economic circumstances reflecting the State surroundings that Zrenjanin found in. At the beginning of 1990’s, when the war broke out on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and
                        the country was falling apart, it led to rather hard social and economic crisis in this area, All that caused an economic stagnation, unemployment, large migrations of refugees from the former Yugoslav Republics: Croatia, Bosnia
                        and Herzegovina. The town experienced the first political changes by the introducing of multiparty system at the end of 1996 when the local government was ruled by the coalition Zajedno (Together) and in 2000 by the coalition Democratic
                        opposition of Serbia. On March 24, 1999 the NATO intervention in Serbia began but the town was not targeted. Life in the town was quite normal, in spite of the dangerous situation elsewhere in the country. In the first years after
                        the end of war activities the Town and its citizens have been adjusting to new economic and social-economic conditions, known as transition. Instead of previous large economic combines and companies plenty of new flexible private
                        enterprises are established and foreign capital is starting to flow in Zrenjanin. New industrial and work and residential zones are formed and the Town's General Plan 2006-2026 and Sustainable Development Strategy 2006-2013 are
                        made and approved. At the end of 2007, introducing a new national territorial organisation followed by necessary legislation, the Municipality of Zrenjanin has been upgraded to an administrative and territorial status of a city.

      <p class="lead">Lazar Agošton, a nobleman opened in Ečka in 1820 new mansions on the left bank of the Begej.
For the opening ceremony every corner of the village was arranged, houses and the yards and the streets were cleaned, lines of trees were formed and triumphal arches were prepared. The chef for the occasion was brought from Vienna. 
Carriages and horses shone to welcome 300 distinguished guests from Vienna and Budapest. The opening ceremony was attended by the famous Count Esterhazy, the richest and most famous nobleman in Hungary.
On the evening of 29 August, 1820 was organized a magnificent torch ceremony was organized. In the morning church bells announced the beginning of the ceremony and invited the inhabitants of Ečka to the celebration and sanctification of the castle.
 After the lunch, the gentlemen were prepared for hunting, and for the ladies boating in gondolas in the Great Lake and the Begej River.
 The highlight of the ceremony was Ečaka ball that looked like magic – wonderful lady gowns, sumptuous uniforms and multicolored Bengal fire along the numerous trails in the park.
On the third day the guests were thrilled by virtuoso playing of Franz Liszt, the “child prodigy” at that time.
The castle was for years a center for lovers of hunting, from home and abroad. Frequent guests were the Austro – Hungarian Crown Prince Franz Ferdinand and Serbian Crown Prince Aleksandar Karadjordjević.
World War II and war destruction did not bypass the Kaštel, and the owners left the castle for good and went to America.
Since the nineties of the twentieth century castle Kaštel is under the protection of the Institute for Cultural Monuments.
Today, this old edifice has been completely renovated and transformed into a facility that will offer its guests an unforgettable vacation in an authentic setting inspired by its aristocratic past.
The castle has 38 rooms and 7 suites, which are a mixture of modern and Medieval style, giving their guests intimate atmosphere, peace and view of the majestic park that surrounds the whole edifice.
In the ballroom, which is a restaurant today, guests can enjoy the delights of national and international cuisine, beautiful music, and an extensive wine list will satisfy even the most demanding clientele.
Surrounded by the beautiful scenery and far from the city Castle Kaštel is ideal for business travelers, conferences, banquets, celebrations, promotions and other events.</p<

		Today Technical Faculty "Mihajlo Pupin " is, after 39 years of its foundation, the most important university level institution in Banat, and a responsible member of the University of Novi Sad. In 2010, 
		the Faculty adopted its Development Strategy in accordance with the strategy of the University, labour market needs and regional social development with simultaneous branding of the faculty increasing its material and nonmaterial values. 
		The base of the Strategy is the choice of study programs interesting for industry, continual improvement of the teaching process quality, development of students' research abilities, students ' and teachers' mobility, cooperation with regional industrial
                                    and institutional environment with an aim of graduated students ' easy and quick integration into industrial courses and their further contribution to increase innovativeness and competitiveness
		of local and regional industry. 

At the moment 2000 students study at the Faculty actively. Instruction at the Faculty on all three levels of academic studies is accredited.
 Basic and master studies are delivered in field of Information Technologies, Industrial Engineering, Clothing Technologies, and Engineering Management on doctoral studies since 2012.
 Engineering of Environmental Safety is a joint study program with the Faculty of Technical Sciences inNovi Sad. The process of re-accreditation is underway, for which we prepare innovations in accordance with the demands and recognized needs of industry.
 A great number of our graduated students work on high positions in worldwide known companies.

Recognizing the problems in smaller urban environments in which industry faces emigration of qualitative human resources,
 the Faculty has established cooperation with business associations that gather the most successful industrial subjects from the region, and in which the students perform activities under the slogan "Working to get a position ".
 The aim of these activities is to introduce students during their studies to real industrial fields, and employers to recognize them as future associates in their business systems.
 One of these associations is the business cycle ZREPOK that gathers businessmen from the region with whom we have had successful cooperation for years with mutual satisfaction.
 Today our Faculty is an institution with the most intensive and innovative-educational process in the region for which we were awarded "Kapetan Misa Anastasijevic " prize.

We are especially proud of the report of the Provincial National Employment Office according to which our faculty is the only one that has a decreasing trend of graduated students' presence on the labour market. It is a result of cooperation with industry
                                    and recognition of industrial problems through teaching process as an integration of students into industrial trends. More and more we often have calls from industry to suggest students who complete their studies and who
                                    are able to handle certain problems. According to the number of papers published in top world journals indexed on SCI list we are on a high position in the Serbian Academic Association. We are on the top inSerbiaaccording
                                    to the number of international conferences where we have partners from the European Union in accordance with the number of employees. The Faculty carries out a great number of international, national, and provincial projects
                                    as projects of cooperation with industry where the number of students is significant. One of the greatest successes of the Faculty was the second place in the World in 2010 in Microsoft 's "Image Cup " competition in the category of software design for solving merciful problems of humanity, 
which is considered to be the greatest success of Serbian informatics until now. We have been the fourth as the most successful representative from our region on the world competition organized by the New Yorker Company held inGermany. 
A Student Researcher Club has been established and it works successfully. Following the quality and high educational standards of theUniversityofNovi Sad,
 very often innovating them, we upgrade our quality daily first directed to effective and qualitative integration of graduated students into industrial fields for we think that their success is the base of our work quality criterion.
